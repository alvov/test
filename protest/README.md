## How to play

Your goal is to fill the protest scale.
 It can be achieved by both:

* increasing the number of protesters
* improving the mood of protesters

1. Protesters **leave** if their mood reaches zero
 (they get red tint). They **also leave** the game
 when they get arrested. New protesters **arrive**
 after you show your poster to a journalist for
 several seconds (mind the small progress bar
 above journalist's head).
2. Protesters mood **decreases** continuously.
 **Cheer them up** by showing them your poster (mind
 the small progress bar above their heads). When
 their mood reaches a high enough level, they also
 start to show posters (and they also get green
 tint). While protesters show posters their mood
 doesn't decrease.

### Enemies

1. **Cops** will chase anyone who shows a poster in
 their field of view (blue cone).
 If they catch you, you loose, game over. You can
 run away from them though if you have enough
 stamina.
2. **SWAT squad** catches anyone who stands on their
 way with or without a poster. Each SWAT soldier
 can grab only one protester. 
 
### Tips

* pick up dropped posters to increase your cheering
 area (it decreases back to normal after some time)
* running time is limited by players stamina with a
 cooldown (mind the small progress bar above
 player's head)
